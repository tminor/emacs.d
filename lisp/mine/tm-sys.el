;;; Commentary:

;; System utils such as `pgrep` implemented in Elisp only.

;;; Code:

(defun tm/pgrep (string)
  "Search process list for any process name matching STRING."
  (interactive "sProcess name: ")
  (let ((pid-list)
        (proc-match))
    ;; Gets a list of PIDs and constructs a list of lists containing
    ;; attribute alists for each process.
    (dolist (pid (list-system-processes) pid-list)
      (setq pid-list (cons (process-attributes pid) pid-list)))
    ;; Looks for STRING in PID-LIST and returns PID.
    (dolist (proc pid-list)
      (if (string-match-p (regexp-quote string)
                          (cdr (assoc-string 'args proc)))
